# Potential HTML Template Malware

I thought I was going to be clever and set up an extremely modern portfolio website exceptionally quickly by utilizing an open source html template. I am not much of a front end develeper. I am more interested in the backend - mainly hardware and low level software. If you sat me down on a desert island and told me I could get off the island by making a modern stylized website, I would die there. So this is exactly what I did. I went to the following url:

```
www[.]html5up[.]net
```

I create a profession quality website, which follows all theelegant design principles of html5 and css3, all in about fifteen minutes. I version controlled everything utilizing gitand hosted the website on the free github pages service. Github pages hosts a server directly from the repote repository. This make pushing updates seemless. My portfolio side was hosted at the following url, however it has since been taken down.

```
https[://]nick-g-1497[.]github[.]io/goralka[.]io/
```

I had been hosting the site for nearly 8 months and it seemed to test well with both HR and technical recruiters.

Where I had notice the malware was when I was making some updates to my portfollio. One of my professors had spoken to me about aiding me in finding an internship, and I wanted to do my due diligence and have an updated resume and portfolio website.

I had noticed when I had staged changes in order to make the updates, when I reviewed the git log, things that had no buisness being added to git were being added. I didn't do any comprehesive malware analysis, however what I suspect from reviewing what got added into the gitlogs is a targeted crawler searching for software written on the system. Initially, I had though there was some sort of error with the VSCode studio extension, but no matter how many times I refreshed the site, the files persisted in the git log. Furthermore, I noted that there wasn't a common root directory where the files were located on the system - they were scattered across the system. It should be noted that anyone using a gui for git like github desktop would never notice.

I had resonable suspision that somewhere obfuscated by the template was some form of malware. As soon as I could, I took the website down, disable network drivers on my laptop, and turned off the power. 

The next day I performed some simple counter surviellance on a backup single-board computer (raspi4) using open source intelligence (the internet). Simple dns resolutions and ip lookups don't yield terribly interesting results. These results are included in the txt files in this repository. However, using a more sophisticated tool such as shodan - it is blatently obvious that the infastructure does not make sense for a benevolent open source project providing cookie cutter solutions to lazy 20 year olds.

I believe this warrents further investagation by someone with more technical expertise than myself.
